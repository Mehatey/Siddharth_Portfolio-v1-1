        Objective: In Haiku Breakout, players control a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy bricks on the screen. Every time the ball hits a brick, a random self-help haiku appears at the bottom of the screen, adding a reflective and calming aspect to the game. The aim is to clear all the bricks while enjoying the poetic wisdom that accompanies each brick hit.         </p>
