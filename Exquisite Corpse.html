    <h1>The Apple Panda Human</h1>

        We had to combine three different body elements into one for this assignment.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Yaxuan Du:</strong> The figure I created has the head of one of the characters from the childhood Chinese animated classic "Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf" - Black Marshal. This cartoon was a huge hit and is still a favorite today. The body part is the Chinese national animal, the panda. Pandas are very cute and loved all over the world, even pandas can be used to promote diplomacy. The legs are bananas because I love bananas and bananas look like legs!
        <br><br>
        <strong>Jun:</strong> My figure is a modernized sphynx who went through some cyberpunk body modification and changed the lower limbs into wheels. The sphinx is shy so she always wears an apple head mask wherever she goes.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Siddharth:</strong> This is a human body made without moving a brush on figma. I wanted to differentiate from the other two complex drawings so as to show the contrast in the figure - simplicity and complexity of what it means to be a human “figure”.
