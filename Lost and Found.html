        This project was about making a vector illustration of a keepsake of a classmate's memory that meant something to them. 
        I was assigned to make Donna's Beanie that she lost but still meant a lot to her. It was neon green with her name.
        It’s a neon yellowish light green beanie. It doesn’t have any patterns, it’s plain. It’s not sharp-edged—it is a flat 
        and circular-shaped one when it’s not in use. The beanie is folded once at the bottom where we put our head. 
        I also remember it had some phrases embroidered on it, but I don’t remember what exactly the words were. 
        The words were embroidered in vertical directions.
